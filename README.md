With DiceBear you can create awesome avatars for your project in no time.
Whether you are looking for abstract shapes or lovingly designed characters, you
will find something suitable among our avatar styles. And no matter how and for
what you want to use the avatars, DiceBear offers the right solution!

In addition to purely random avatars, you can also create deterministic avatars
for user identities. With the built-in PRNG you create the same avatar over and
over again based on a seed. But also individual avatars are possible! Just use
the countless options that each avatar style provides.

And thanks to the JavaScript library, HTTP API, CLI, Figma plugin and
Playground, your next avatar is always just a stone's throw away!
